Firewall: A network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): An additional layer of security requiring not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand.

Botnet: A network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners’ knowledge.
Example: Botnets can be used to perform distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Example: The Stuxnet worm exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to target Iran’s nuclear facilities.
